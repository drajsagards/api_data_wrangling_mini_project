# api_data_wrangling_mini_project
Practice new data wrangling techniques using API. I'm going to use the Quandl free API to perform the data wrangling and find out the following  
1. Collect data from the Franfurt Stock Exchange, for the ticker AFX_X, for the whole year 2020
2. Convert the returned JSON object into a Python dictionary.
3. Calculate what the highest and lowest opening prices were for the stock in this period.
4. What was the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price)?
5. What was the largest change between any two days (based on Closing Price)?
6. What was the average daily trading volume during this year?
7. What was the median trading volume during this year
